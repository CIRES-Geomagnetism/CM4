# CM4
This folder contains two files which are wrappers of two respective fortran files which are the code for cm4. 
These files are cm4field_module and interactive_cm4 module. With their respective fortran code in the files without the _module suffix. The hello.f90 code is a proof of concept for wrapping fortran in python. While this is being developed I figured it would be handy to hold onto.
